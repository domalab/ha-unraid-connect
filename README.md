## ⚠️ Project Status Update

Due to time constraints, I am no longer able to actively develop and support this integration. 

### Recommended Alternative

I encourage users to check out **[chris-mc1's Unraid API integration](https://github.com/chris-mc1/unraid_api)**, which is under active development and provides an alternative solution for integrating Unraid with Home Assistant.

### What this means

- This repository will remain available for reference and forking
- No new features or bug fixes will be implemented
- Pull requests may not be reviewed or merged
- Issues will not be actively addressed

Thank you for your understanding and support. I hope the recommended alternative integration serves your needs well.
