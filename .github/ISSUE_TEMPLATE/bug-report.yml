      description: "Clear description of what's wrong and what you expected to happen"
      placeholder: |
        **What's happening:**
        Docker container switches don't work - when I try to start/stop containers in HA, nothing happens on Unraid.

        **What should happen:**
        Containers should start/stop when I toggle the switches in Home Assistant.

        **When did this start:**
        After updating to version v0.1.0-beta.6

        **Additional context:**
        Include any error messages, affected entities, or specific scenarios. Note: Some issues may be due to known GraphQL API limitations.
